## How Branching 2.0 works

With Branching 2.0, you can do the following directly from the Supabase dashboard:

- Create preview branches
- Pull production branch changes into a branch
- Merge a branch into production to deploy the changes

## Enable Branching 2.0

Branching 2.0 is available as a Feature Preview. To enable Branching 2.0 in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Open the user menu by clicking on your user icon in the top right.
1. Select **Branching 2.0**.
1. Click **Enable feature**.

## Creating a branch

Once you've enabled Branching 2.0, you can create a new branch:

1. Click the arrows next to the branch name in the top menu bar. (The top menu bar has the format `YOUR_ORGANIZATION / YOUR_PROJECT / CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME`.)
2. Click `Create branch`.

## Making changes to a branch

Use the branch selector in the top bar to change to your branch. Any changes you make (including SQL run in the SQL editor, table editor changes, and configuration changes) are now made against the currently selected branch.

You can also use the branch's API keys and connection strings to run changes against the branch from your own code or SQL client.

## Pulling changes from production into a branch

1. Change to your branch using the branch selector in the top menu.
1. Open the branch selector again, and click **Review changes**.
1. If there are changes that you need to pull from production, a message will show, prompting you to update your branch. Click **Update branch**.

## Merging changes from a branch into production

1. Change to your branch using the branch selector in the top menu.
1. Open the branch selector again, and click **Review changes**.
1. [Pull any changes](#pulling-changes-from-production-into-a-branch) if necessary.
1. Click **Merge branch**.
