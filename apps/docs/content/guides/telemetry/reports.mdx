The Supabase Dashboard provides historical monitoring charts that visualize key database metrics. These charts help you identify performance bottlenecks, resource constraints, and optimization opportunities at a glance.

## Database reports

<Admonition type="note">

Advanced Database monitoring charts are currently available only for Teams and Enterprise plans.
[Upgrade your plan](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing) to access these features.

### Memory usage

    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/memory-usage-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart shows memory allocation across:

- **Used**: RAM actively used by Postgres and the operating system
- **Cache + buffers**: Memory used for page cache and Postgres buffers
- **Free**: Available unallocated memory

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Identify memory pressure when free memory is consistently low
- Monitor cache effectiveness for query performance
- Detect memory leaks or inefficient memory usage

**Actions you can take:**

- [Upgrade compute size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#compute-size) for more memory
- Optimize queries that consume excessive memory
- Tune Postgres configuration for better memory management
- Implement query result caching at the application level

### CPU usage

  src={{
    dark: '/docs/img/database/reports/cpu-usage-chart-dark.png',
    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/cpu-usage-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart breaks down CPU usage by category:

- **System**: CPU time for kernel operations
- **User**: CPU time for database queries and user processes
- **IOWait**: CPU time waiting for disk/network IO
- **IRQs**: CPU time handling interrupts
- **Other**: CPU time for miscellaneous tasks

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Identify CPU-intensive queries when User CPU is high
- Detect IO bottlenecks when IOWait is elevated
- Monitor system overhead and resource contention

**Actions you can take:**

- Optimize CPU-intensive queries identified through high User CPU
- Address IO bottlenecks if IOWait is consistently high
- [Upgrade compute size](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk) for more CPU capacity
- Use query optimization techniques and [proper indexing](/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes)

### Disk Input/Output operations per second (IOPS)

    dark: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-iops-chart-dark.png',
    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-iops-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart displays read and write IOPS with a reference line showing your compute size's maximum IOPS capacity.

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Identify when disk IO becomes a bottleneck
- Distinguish between read-heavy vs write-heavy workloads
- Spot spikes in disk activity that correlate with performance issues

**Actions you can take:**

- Optimize queries causing high read IOPS through better indexing
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Batch write operations to reduce write IOPS
- [Upgrade compute size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk) for higher IOPS limits

### Disk IO Usage

  src={{
    dark: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-io-chart-dark.png',
    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-io-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart displays the percentage of your allocated IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) currently being used.

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Identify when you're approaching your IOPS limits
- Correlate high IO usage with performance issues
- Monitor the impact of database operations on disk performance

**Actions you can take:**

- Optimize queries that perform excessive disk reads/writes
- Add appropriate indexes to reduce sequential scans
- Consider upgrading to a [larger compute size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk) for higher IOPS limits
- Review and optimize your database schema and query patterns

### Disk Size

  src={{
    dark: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-size-chart-dark.png',
    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/disk-size-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart shows disk usage breakdown including:

- **Database**: Space used by your actual database data (tables, indexes)
- **WAL**: Space used by Write-Ahead Logging
- **System**: Reserved space for system operations

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Monitor disk space consumption trends
- Identify rapid growth that may require attention
- Plan for disk space upgrades before hitting limits

**Actions you can take:**

- Run [VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) operations to reclaim dead tuple space
- Identify and optimize large tables using the CLI commands like `table-sizes`
- Consider data archival strategies for historical data
- [Upgrade disk size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/database-size) when approaching capacity

### Database client connections

    dark: '/docs/img/database/reports/db-client-connections-chart-dark.png',
    light: '/docs/img/database/reports/db-client-connections-chart-light.png',
  }}
/>

This chart shows the number of active connections to your database broken down by connection type:

- **Postgres**: Direct connections from your application
- **PostgREST**: Connections from the PostgREST API layer
- **Reserved**: Administrative connections for Supabase services
- **Auth**: Connections from Supabase Auth service
- **Storage**: Connections from Supabase Storage service
- **Other roles**: Miscellaneous database connections

**How it helps debug issues:**

- Identify connection pool exhaustion when approaching max connections
- Spot connection leaks from applications not properly closing connections
- Monitor connection distribution across different services

**Actions you can take:**

- [Upgrade your compute size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#compute-size) to increase connection limits
- Implement [connection pooling](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#shared-pooler) for better connection management in your application if you see high direct connections
- Review your application code for proper connection handling
